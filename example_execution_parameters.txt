Example:

For a single simulation with replisome velocity = 1 bp/sec, 10 replisomes, 
transcription period of 150 sec and at most 3 million simulation iterations:

python3 ./main.py --organism 'Trypanosoma brucei brucei TREU927' --resources 10 11 1 --speed 1 2 1 --period 150 --timout 3000000 --cells 1
